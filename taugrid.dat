  Sample tau-grid

This file can start with an arbitrary number of text lines (WARNING: the text 
must not contain the "equal" sign!). The beginning of data is signaled by the 
entry of the fiducial wavelength at which the optical depths are specified. The 
list entries are one per line in arbitrary order --- DUSTY will sort the list 
and use only the sorted version for internal work and output.  The number of 
entries is limited to 999.
