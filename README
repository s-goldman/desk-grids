All the important files have my initials "srg" in the name. 

To run:
    compile dusty, e.g.:    gfortran dustyV2.f -std=legacy -o dusty
    run the code:           python srg_dusty_grid.py

Another example of json file is example_silicate_mix_srg_dust_grid.json
which was used for the silicate-mix grid.

Input parameters (in srg_dust_grid.json)
----------------------------------------------------
grid_name               (str)               name of your grid
test                    (bool)              if true, code will run in test mode
remove_previous         (bool)              if true, code will delete files from previous run
n_cores                 (null or int)       number of cores to use, uses all but one if null
grain_a_filename        (str)               dust optical constant file for first grain type
grain_b_filename        (str)               " second grain type
grain_c_filename        (str)               " third grain type
grain_d_filename        (str)               " fourth grain type
effective_temp_grid     (array)             effective temperature(s) of BB used for model
inner_dust_temp_grid    (array)             inner dust temperature(s) of model
grain_type_a_grid       (array)             grain fraction (totalling 100%) for first grain type   
grain_type_b_grid       (array)             " second grain type
grain_type_d_grid       (array)             " fourth grain type
tau_number              (int)               number of individual optical depths to consider
tau_max                 (float)             maximum optical depth at 10um for models

The fraction for the third grain type is the remainder of the total 
grain fraction after the first three grain types have been accounted for, 
so long as the total is 100% or less.

DUSTY instructions for changing wavelength sampling:
----------------------------------------------------
Change lambda_grid.dat to change wavelength sampling
Change userpar.inc
Recompile with gfortran dustyV2.f -std=legacy -o dusty
run srg_dusty_grid.py
